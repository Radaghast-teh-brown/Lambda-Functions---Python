These are my notes of lambda functions in Python. I have seen this function beeing used in different algorithms, so I have dicided to understand it. 

## Why to use

We can define functions in Python using the way
 ```
 def pitagoras(x,y):
    return x**2 + y**2
 
 ```
Using lambda functions we can define functions indirectaly and use them inside another functions. We can make the same function using less words.

```
pitagoras = lambda x,y: x**2 + y**2
```
